# Description
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
<br>
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.



# Example 1
<b>Input:</b> nums = [3,2,3]
<br>
<b>Output:</b> 3

# Example 2:
<b>Input:</b> nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
<br>
<b>Output:</b> 2


# Constraints
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109


# Follow-up
Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
