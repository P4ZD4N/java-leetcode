# Description
The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

- For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.

Given an integer num, return its complement.

# Example 1
<b>Input:</b> num = 5
<br>
<b>Output:</b> 2
<br>
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

# Example 2
<b>Input:</b> num = 1
<br>
<b>Output:</b> 0
<br>
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

# Constraints
- 1 <= num < 231
